## Introduction
* Montreal Path Finder is an application that provides a safe path between two coordinates on the map, avoiding high-crime areas in Montreal city. 
* The program implements an A* heuristic algorithm to analyze crime data and suggest a safe path for traveling.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries are used to develop this application:
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Shapefile](https://pypi.org/project/pyshp/#the-reader-class)
* [statistics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html)

## Getting Started
* To run Montreal Path Finder, simply execute mainfile.py and follow the prompts.

## Future Scope
* Alerts for high-risk areas using real-time location data
* A live path feature for real-time navigation
* GUI for improved user experience
